I am an IT professional with over 20 years of experience in the banking industry, with the last 8 years focused on working with the AWS platform. I have worked on numerous large-scale projects, including DST, CMS, and more. I hold AWS Professional Architect and Security certifications, demonstrating my deep knowledge and expertise in cloud technologies.

My favorite projects involve cloud migration and designing scalable architectures. I enjoy the challenge of transforming traditional IT infrastructure into highly scalable and resilient cloud-based systems. This not only optimizes performance but also significantly reduces costs and increases the agility of the organization.

Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated a strong ability to manage projects from conception to completion, and I have a proven track record of using innovative solutions to solve complex problems.

I am passionate about leveraging my technical skills to drive improvements and optimize performance in the IT sector. I am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies in the ever-evolving world of software development.
